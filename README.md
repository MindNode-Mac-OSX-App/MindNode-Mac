## 📊 Overview  

MindNode is a streamlined mind-mapping platform built to help users capture thoughts visually, structure complex information, and refine ideas with clarity. Designed for thinkers, planners, educators, and creatives, MindNode transforms scattered concepts into beautifully organized diagrams that evolve as your understanding grows.

The app focuses on fluid idea development. Starting with a central concept, you can build branching thoughts, subtopics, relationships, and tasks—all through an elegant and minimalist interface. Visual tools make it easy to move nodes, experiment with layouts, adjust styling, and highlight relationships using colors, tags, and icons. MindNode supports images, notes, links, and attachments, allowing you to enrich maps without cluttering your workspace.

Beyond traditional mind mapping, MindNode includes an Outlining Mode which automatically converts your visual map into a structured text outline. This dual-perspective approach is perfect for planning essays, presentations, workflows, or multi-stage projects. Focus Mode helps you concentrate on a specific branch by dimming everything else, enabling deep work without visual noise.

Task tracking is built directly into map nodes, supporting checklists and basic project management. Thanks to cloud synchronization, your maps stay updated across devices, letting you brainstorm on the go and refine at your desk. Export options—such as PDF, PNG, or text-based outlines—ensure that your work integrates smoothly into broader workflows or collaborative environments.

MindNode’s polished interface and balance of simplicity and functionality make it an excellent tool for turning abstract thinking into structured clarity, whether for personal planning, academic study, or professional ideation.
